# Product Mission

## Problem

Families accumulate videos and clips across phones, cameras, and devices over the years — birthdays, vacations, milestones — but there's no central, enjoyable way to organize, browse, and watch them. Content stays buried in camera rolls or scattered cloud folders. Sharing with extended family and friends is awkward and fragmented.

## Target Users

Family members and friends of all ages. A small number of admins (typically parents or tech-savvy family members) curate and manage content. A larger circle of viewers — grandparents, siblings, cousins, friends — browse and watch through a polished, familiar interface.

## Solution

A private Netflix-style streaming platform for family memories. Users select their profile (with personal avatar), then browse clips organized by category in a cinematic, dark-themed UI with smooth animations and transitions. The video player mirrors Netflix's feature set (progress bar, skip, quality controls). An admin area allows managing clips, categories, and user profiles. The experience works on both web browsers and TV screens, making family movie night as easy as opening Netflix.

**What makes it unique:**
- Netflix-quality UX for private family content — not a file manager, a streaming experience
- Built on Zadara NGOS for reliable on-prem/hybrid media storage
- Supabase for fast, real-time metadata management
- Deployed on Google Cloud Run for scalable, cost-efficient hosting
